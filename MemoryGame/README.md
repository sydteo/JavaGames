# memoryGame

**What is this about?**
- memoryGame is a basic game where the objective is to match 2 same cards at a time
- I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this simple yet fun game
- This was inspired by @AniaKubow upon finishing a 12h Bootcamp in 2021.


**What I learnt.**
- How HTML, CSS and javascript work together for web development
- Flexbox and basic styling
- Elements and classes 
- JavaScript in-built methods, namely: addEventListeners, createElement, setAttribute, getAttribute

**Things to improve on.**
- Be more familiar with the basic JavaScript methods
